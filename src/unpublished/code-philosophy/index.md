Coding is like litterature : there are many languages, along with their specific rules/grammar, and on top of these bases, there are a panel of styles : for litterature it could be **philosophical**, with big and great concepts but not easy to read for a beginner, **childish** going straight to the point with no complexity at all, **romantic** of any kind, etc.

In coding, style exists too. One can creates custom hooks everywhere in its code, one other can apply the DRY (**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself) method all over the place, another could use libraries for any piece of intelligence required... a lot of styles exists in the coding world.

I'll try to explain below the style we try to achieve within Selego. I don't say it's the best or the other ones are bad. In my opinion, there is no need to make such brutal judgements : any pattern is good, as long as it is used with balance. A DRY method brought to its extreme can be very bad, very unconstructive and unefficient, but the DRY method, if used with balanced, makes a lot of sense as it would be inefficient to repeat a complex algorithm many time throughout the codebase.

That'll introduce the first concept we try to achieve with the Selego's developers.

# Apply any principles with balance
